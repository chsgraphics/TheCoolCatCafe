   p The Cool Cat Café has been the home of premiere catty cuisine since our establishment in 1600. Our founder, Dave (who is definitely not several cats stacked on top of each other in a suspiciously long trench coat, no matter what the rumors say—uh, we mean, who is one metaphorically cool cat), has purrsonally paw-picked the menu to be furociously tasty and the decor to be impawssibly splendid.
